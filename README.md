-Set up:
-First, I started by setting up my Azure AI account with my student email
-Second, I created a new GitHub repository for the project.
-Third, I created an agent on Azure and started to browse different models. 
  - This is my first time using the platform so I wanted to browse the different resources it offers.
  - I also explored the playground section which was pretty interesting. I am going to need to play with it more to fully be comfortable.
-Fourth, I conducted research on how to properly deploy research assistant agent.
